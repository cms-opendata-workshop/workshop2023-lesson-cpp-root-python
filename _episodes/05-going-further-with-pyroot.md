## PyROOT

The PyROOT project started with Wim Lavrijsen in the late `00s and became very popular, 
paralleling the rise of more general python tools within the community. 

If you want to learn how to use PyROOT, you can go through some individual examples
[here](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/group__tutorial__pyroot.html), or a more guided tutorial
[here](https://root.cern/manual/python/).

Feel free to challenge yourself to rewrite the previous C++ code using PyROOT!
